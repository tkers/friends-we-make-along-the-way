        <strong>Equipment</strong> You'll need a (preferably large) blank piece
        of paper, some pencils, a standard set of 52 playing cards, and a couple
        of 6-sided dice. Optionally a ruler or chart divider to help plot your
        course on the map &mdash; though a seasoned captain can also just
        eyeball it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prepare</strong> Place the piece of paper on a table, this will
        be your ocean chart. Shuffle the deck of cards (remove any jokers) and
        place it face-down next to the map. Decide on a name for your captain &
        ship. What is your backstory? What are you searching for out there? All
        ships start with 5 Hull Points (HP) and 3 Gold Pieces (GP). Mark this
        down on your character sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Set Sail</strong> Both players start by marking their starting
        location on the map, and naming the port they're docked at. Take turns
        introducing your character and ship, and draw the ports on the map.
        Don't forget to add the coastline as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Discover</strong> Take turns sailing your ship accross the
        ocean. You can move at most 10 cm per turn. After plotting your course,
        draw a path on the chart and take a card from the deck. Consult the
        table below to see what you discovered on your voyage. Describe your
        discovery to the other players, and draw it on the map around your
        ship's location. If a previously discovered location is in range of your
        ship, you can also opt to sail there instead of taking a new card.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Suit & Rank</strong> Your voyage depends on the cards you draw
        from the deck. The <em>suit</em> indicates the type of your discovery:

        <span class="black">♠</span> seagoing vessels,
        <span class="red">♥</span> creatures of the sea,
        <span class="black">♣</span> natural phenomena,
        <span class="red">♦</span> structures ashore.
      </p>

      <p>Depending on the card's <em>rank</em>, you find something...</p>

        <strong>batten down the hatches</strong> Some encounters are less
        pleasant than others. If you ever find yourself caught in a
        ship-crushing vortex, a treacherous siren ambush, or a pirate's cannon
        fire, it's time to fight back! Roll <em>2d6</em> and add an extra d6 for
        your ship's proficiencies. If you roll a <em>6</em>, you fend off the
        danger succesfully. If you roll a <em>4</em> or <em>5</em>, you succeed
        but take a small hit. On anything else, you take a hit and roll again.
