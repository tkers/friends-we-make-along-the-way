      <p>
        <strong>Supplies</strong> You'll need a standard set of
        <em>52 playing cards</em> (without jokers), a
        <em>piece of paper</em> (this will be your ocean chart), a
        <em>pen or pencil</em> to draw with, and a couple of
        <em>6-sided dice</em>. Optionally a ruler or chart divider to help plot
        your course on the map &mdash; though a seasoned captain could always
        just eyeball it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Preparations</strong> Shuffle the deck of cards and place it
        face-down next to the piece of paper. Decide on a name for your captain
        and ship. What is your backstory? What are the unique features of your
        ship?
      </p>
      <p>
        Both players may start with <em>5 HP</em> (Hull Points) and
        <em>3 GP</em> (Gold Pieces). Mark this down on the ocean chart.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Weigh Anchor</strong> Both players start by marking their home
        location on the map, and naming the harbour they're docked at. Take
        turns introducing your character and ship, and draw the harbour on the
        map. Don't forget to add (a part of) the coastline as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Discover</strong> Take turns sailing your ship accross the
        ocean. Agree how far you can move during a turn. Plot your course on the
        chart and take a card from the top of the deck. Consult the table below
        to see what you discover at the next location.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a previously discovered location is in range of your ship, you can
        also opt to sail there instead of taking a new card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Describe your discovery to the other player, and draw it on the map. In
        which ways does this encounter affect your voyage? How does your crew
        feel about the decisions you make?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Batten Down the Hatches</strong> Some encounters are less
        pleasant than others. If you ever find yourself caught in a
        ship-crushing vortex, a treacherous siren ambush, or a pirate's cannon
        fire, it's time to fight back! Roll <em>2d6</em> and keep the highest
        value. If you roll a <em>6</em>, you fend off the danger succesfully and
        gain some loot. If you roll a <em>4</em> or <em>5</em>, you succeed but
        at what cost? On <em>1-3</em>, you take a hit and flee to your previous
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Returning Home</strong> Once a large part of the chart has been
        discovered and you start running low on provisions, it's time to begin
        your journey home. Reflect back on your voyage. What is the condition of
        your ship and crew? Did you find what you were looking for? Which
        friends did you make along the way?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Suit & Rank</strong> Your discoveries depend on the cards you
        draw from the deck:
