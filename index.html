        <strong>Equipment</strong> You'll need a (preferably large) blank piece
        of paper, some pencils, and a couple of 6-sided dice. Optionally a ruler
        or chart divider to help plot your course &mdash; though a seasoned
        captain can also just eyeball it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prepare</strong> Place the piece of paper on a table, this will
        be your ocean chart. Decide on a name for your captain & ship. What is
        your backstory? What are you searching for out there?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Set Sail</strong> Both players start by marking their starting
        location on the chart, and naming the port they're docked at. Take turns
        drawing your ports on the chart, and don't forget to add the coastline.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Discover</strong> Take turns sailing your ship accross the
        ocean. You can move at most 10 cm per turn. After plotting your course,
        draw a path on the chart and take a card from the deck. Consult the
        oracle below to see what you discovered on your voyage. Describe the
        encounter to the other players, and draw it on the map around your
        ship's location.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fight for your life!</strong> Some encounters are less pleasant
        than others. If you find yourself caught in the stream of a
        ship-crushing vortex, a dangerous mermaid ambush, or a rival pirate's
        cannon fire, it's time to fight back! Roll <em>2d6</em> and add an extra
        d6 for your ship's proficiencies. If you roll a <em>6</em>, you fend off
        the danger succesfully. If you roll a <em>4</em> or <em>5</em>, you
        succeed but take a small hit. On anything else, you take a hit and roll
        again.
